# Interface Information

The grasping capabilities package provides manipulator motion and state interfaces. Motion execution is delegated to the grasping stack, which owns workspace loading, planning-scene setup, and MoveIt planning configuration. State readers publish their results directly as event parameters.

## ActivateSceneRunner

## MoveToJointPoseRunner

This runner sends an explicit joint-space target through `grasping_msgs/action/MoveToJointPose`. The runner passes only the target joint state; planning-group, planner, tolerance, and scene configuration are loaded by the grasping stack from its ROS parameters.

Output Parameters:

| Parameter Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| success | bool | Whether the grasping action reported a successful execution. |
| message | string | Final status returned by the grasping motion server. |

## ListNamedPosesRunner

This runner calls `grasping_msgs/srv/ListNamedPoses` and emits the configured pose names with their descriptions.
